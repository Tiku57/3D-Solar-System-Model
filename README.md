# üåç 3D Solar System Simulation
A JavaScript (ThreeJS) Project

This project creates an interactive 3D simulation of our solar system using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a powerful JavaScript 3D library. It features the Sun at the center with all eight planets orbiting and rotating. Users can control the orbital speed of individual planets, pause/resume the animation, and toggle between dark and light themes.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Realistic 3D Scene**: The Sun and all eight planets (Mercury to Neptune) rendered as 3D spheres.
- **Orbital and Rotational Animation**: Planets orbit the Sun along elliptical paths and rotate on their own axes.
- **Axial Tilts**: Planets are rendered with realistic axial tilts for a more accurate visual representation.
- **Saturn's Ring**: Saturn is depicted with a prominent ring system.
- **Speed Control**: Individual sliders allow real-time adjustment of each planet's orbital speed.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: A button to pause and resume the entire simulation.
- **Camera Controls**: Drag your mouse or touch to rotate the camera around the solar system.
- **Planet Tooltips**: Hovering over a planet (or touching on mobile) displays its name.
- **Starfield Background**: A dynamic background of stars that changes color with the theme.
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes for the UI, stars, and orbit lines.
